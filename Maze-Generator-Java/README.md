# Maze Generator (Java)

This is a very simple program to generate mazes written in Java.

I also had the idea to use my pathSolver to find the best way through the maze, a class that converts the Maze object into a Board is available in the PathSolver repository, and one example on how to use it is available.

After downloading the package mazeGenerator, just compile both classes and run: Main contains an example on how to use the class, Maze is the class that generates the maze.
