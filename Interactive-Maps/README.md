  * Railway network density

* Clicking on an earthquake will show only cities that may be affected by it

Airports and routes overlay:
* Displays thousands of airports located worldwide

Life expectancy overlay:
* Shades the countries in the map with their corresponding life expectancy

Rail network density overlay:
* Uses 2 different data sources: railroad network size and country area, using this data to calculate the density
* Shades the countries in the map with their corresponding density

Some of the base code was provided by:
* UC San Diego Intermediate Software Development MOOC team
