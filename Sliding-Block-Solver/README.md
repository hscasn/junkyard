# Sliding Block Solver

An algorithm to solve sliding puzzles (8 piece puzzle). It uses A* search with manhattan and hamming distances to calculate the priority of the moves.

To use it, download the "slidingBlockSolver" package, it contains 3 classes:
- Board: Represents a board
- Solver: Contains the algorithm to solve the board
- Main: Optional, contains a program to run test cases

The other package, "testCases", contains test cases for testing the algorithm. You must download this package if you intend to run the "Main" class to test the program.
