# COBOL-Inventory-Control

  This application simulates a simple inventory control app in COBOL. It uses a .dat file to register data for products available in stock, their titles, prices and IDs. For every purchase recorded, the quantity available of the items is subtracted from the .dat file.
  
Due to the access being relative, it is not possible to edit the file in a normal text editor.
  
  This application is not ment to be used in mainframes, since it requires input from the console. It should only be used as
an example for producing COBOL applications.

The application contains the following functionalities:
  * Display products
  * Search product by ID
  * Insert new product
  * Update product
  * Remove product
  * Display purchases receipt
  * New purchase receipt
  * Record purchase
